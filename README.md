# Linux System Monitoring & Permissions Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates **practical Linux skills** applied to cybersecurity monitoring and SOC operations.  
The objective is to understand system logging, authentication monitoring, and file permission management in a real Linux environment.

---

## Tool & Environment
- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu)  
- **Logs Analyzed:** `auth.log`, `syslog`  
- **Commands Used:** `tail`, `chmod`, `ls`

---

## Methodology
1. Monitored authentication logs (`auth.log`) to identify failed login attempts  
2. Observed real-time system activity using `syslog`  
3. Managed file and directory permissions using Linux permission commands (`chmod`, `ls`)

---

## Screenshots
- **Failed_login.png:** Captures failed authentication attempts from `auth.log`  
- **Syslog_tail.png:** Shows monitoring of recent system activity  
- **Permissions.png:** Demonstrates file permission management

---

## Result
- Successfully monitored system logs for suspicious activity  
- Managed file permissions to enforce security controls  
- Gained hands-on experience with Linux system monitoring and SOC practices

---

## Ethical Notice
All activities were performed on a **personal Linux system** in a controlled environment for learning purposes only.  

---

## Key Learnings
- Identifying suspicious login attempts through authentication logs  
- Monitoring system activity using Linux log files  
- Understanding and managing Linux file permissions  
- Applying Linux skills to SOC and security monitoring tasks
