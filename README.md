# Linux – System Monitoring and Permissions Lab

## Overview
This lab demonstrates practical Linux skills used in cybersecurity monitoring and SOC operations.  
The objective is to understand system logging, authentication monitoring, and file permission management.

## Tool & Environment
- OS: Linux (Ubuntu)  
- Logs Analyzed: auth.log, syslog  
- Commands Used: tail, chmod, ls  

## Methodology
- Monitored authentication logs to identify failed login attempts  
- Observed real-time system activity using system log files  
- Managed file and directory permissions using Linux permission commands  

## Screenshots
Screenshots are provided to demonstrate Linux system monitoring and permission handling.

- **Failed_login.png**: Captures failed authentication attempts from `auth.log`  
- **Syslog_tail.png**: Shows monitoring of recent system activity using `syslog`  
- **Permissions.png**: Demonstrates file permission management using `chmod` and `ls`  

## Result
Successfully monitored system logs and managed file permissions to support basic security monitoring tasks.

## Ethical Notice
All activities were performed on a personal Linux system in a controlled environment for learning purposes only.

## Key Learnings
- Identifying suspicious login attempts through authentication logs  
- Monitoring system activity using Linux log files  
- Understanding and managing Linux file permissions  
- Applying Linux skills to SOC and security monitoring tasks
